# About Me
 ## Name: John Bolan
Full Discloser:  This is an anonymous pseudonym for the Web so that I people can track who I am on the web and what I said without a mistake coming to hunt me 3 decades later. See the unjust treatment of anyone conservitive or who loves the many good things of American past in politics.  I will post ideas of how we should reform this country. I am well aware as I take positions on the web my views might change. This should not affect my living income.  I am well aware I might be wrong and that you could convince me. Or I might and will have a controversial position because I took a stance. If you don't stand for something you can fall for anything. If I change I should be able to point to a pivot point , as Glenn Beck defined them, and basically tell you what caused the change. Give me the courtesy that I am focused on being a good person, that I take a position not based in stupidity or evil.

## Status: Not perfect but getting better aka changing.
 A good person.  I study religion and God and attempt to apply it. I study money in an attempt to be productive and independent. I pay attention to the structure and founding thoughts and set up of the federal government. I need to do better in areas such as ``` [redacted] ```

## Education
High School
Collage: It is complicated attempted engineering, I didn't get it past Sophomore Junior levels. 120 credits with many good grades and many bad grades. I am too poor for collage. Loans and the expense of taking courses without financial aid prevent me from taking a different track. I may have an opportunity to slowly 2 credit hours per semester for business but not sure what that would do for me. I am currently soaking up knowledge from online free videos but I am floundering on what to learn. I am doing this web-page as a learn by doing effort. I am musing a portfolio of skills or items done.
