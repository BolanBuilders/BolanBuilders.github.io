# Trump is Dumb
#### The title is click bate
I am going to write a political post just because I was watching a suggested YouTube video, Trump makes America Dumb, By the Young Turks.  I disagreed with their message. I think the "Rich" are fantastic.  I looked at David Ramsey's book and what he said are the things to spend money on. I look at John Huntsman who wants to die poor giving his money to hospitals.  I am going to write a long post because my rebuttal can't be short, because the rebuttal sounds ridiculous without context.  

The rich can be the good guys.  Spending on schools by the top levels of government are bad. Trump is right to cut funding to schools.   How can I say that? The Turks dismissed the privatization of schools saying once schools are privatized, vouchers go away. That only works if **the government only cares about money if they have control of the money.** So point to them. But we can be better and if they really wanted to so could Congress.   

 But here is a point to me. Trump being president is the war on poverties fault. The reason Trump is president is that he could fund his own ticket. The reason Trump could fund his own ticket is that his **capital for his businesses came from the Government**. His grandfather built the projects in New York City and Jersey. The progressives or liberals created Trumps Father and Trump came back to hurt them in education. It's their own fault. What will the person who made it rich off of Obama Care, or Medicare, or Social Security Disabilities,  or the F-35 program or any outrageous spent amount of money do to our nation?  Federal government spending doesn't create disciplined organized people working for the common good. It doesn't create fairness or social justice.

Now back to my outrageous claims.  We need spending for schools. We need those tax cuts for the "Rich" so lower levels of government can up taxes and give vouchers and have control of local children so they can do things differently that actually might teach our kids better.  No vouchers is no economic freedom, to change our system. Right now it is the current PONTUS way or the highway. The caveat is that it is the Congress that is controlling the money.  An important caveat because Congress is only letting Trump do this.
## Vouchers could be

I digress, because one of my points is that religion can create disciplined organized, and better people. So I could have a local church group run a charter, that could teach kids to forgive others, to seek the spirit of the Lord in learning facts about math and science, and computer programming.

This hypothetical school is to have uniforms to promote unity with others. Unity is a founding principle that the nation was built upon. It also prevents clothing showing unity to other ideas like Marxism, Communism, socialism, capitalism, gangs,freedom, slavery,and coca cola. Not everything is bad in the previous list, but not everything is good.

 What about a prayer at football games and in class? Prayer teaches student to be grateful and show gratitude for what they do have, and ask for help with learning and of course wining the game. We don't have to teach lessons, define Godly attributes or dedicate temples with this prayer. Just say we acknowlege there is a God, we are greatful for good thing, we would like help in reaching a good goal,learning , and being disciplined and orgaized.

 This charter could also have the freedom to teach the kids skills like markdown which leads to the concept of markup languages like HTML and CSS to format, pages. Plus text editors are cheap, and open source.  And the church owned school could also teach evolution and creationism, and maybe some critical thinking so they can reject that the earth is 10k years old.   Because it is not. I don't think the Bible teaches that either.  This earth was organized from preexisting cosmic materials and I don't think there was a time limit on its creation. I digress. Truth is truth and won't conflict and eventually will be sorted out. Teach them the skill of honest questions and thinking. The cognitive disnence of haveing a prayer aknowlegeing God and then asking a question in a history, social studies, or english class, Is there a God, is not cripeling.  You can follow up with two papers assigned, if there is a God then these peoples actions were right or wrong at this event. And second paper if there is no God then the idea of God led to this good or bad thing at this event. The point is you are still teaching the cause of most events in history, religion, the event, critical thinking of cause and effect and the mushy english rules and grammer of the time period. You can grade a paper with out gradeing the ideas behind it.

I think that such a school would have better scores than any school current public schools. I don't think that a separation of government applies because the federal government isnt the circulum maker. The money is also given out on an equal basis, the money goes with the child period.  If I am wrong and the kids don't pass the standard tests for reading, then the school next door will take the voucher.

Without a uniform, prayer, raspberry pi's with their atom word editors, and with a chalkboard and lined paper with pencils for each student to do the math and a teacher with a library reading **Charlotte's Web** or **Hank the Cowdog** to get kids in love with reading, some of the kids will succeed.  I don't think I turned out an illiterate buffon and I went to the public school without the fancy stuff.
## So what do we need?
Places to put our pupils, so land and cheap buildings. Built out of engineered earth with appropriate tensile strengthened materials. Or wood or steel or brick. We will need an AC unit and or swamp coolers, pellet stoves or nuclear powered electric heaters and some double-hulled tents for insulation. The point is schools can be built with a varity of materials.  If there is a huge controvery reguarding circulum and there being to many schools then local district should be able to vote on how many local school/circulums there are. Even if you limit it to an arbitray 3 schools allowed for the area there will be a choice and local control.
In the same vain, basic workplace amenities for the teachers. We need a meeting room, a break room, and a whole lot of restrooms.
The aforementioned furniture, workspaces that are desks or tables. Kids and adults cannot stand all day. So chairs. Chairs could even be made our of cardboard. Not sure about tables or desks being made with cardboard though. Also a Silent Study Area and a Noise Study area for group study.
## School supplies
We need some way to communicate language or math. Enter Slates, Rocketbook Notebooks, Butcher Paper, pencil, pens as possibilities. A bonus to a school having small computers like Chromebooks or Cloudbooks or Raspberry Pis.  These would need software with editors like Vim, Nano, Atom, Retext, Sublime, The Mathematica on the Raspberry Pi or Latex WYSIWYG math editors.
## Curriculum
Well, Math is a tool to express yourselves in such a way that you can logically find a missing truth. We need it. It allows some of the toughest engineering problems to be solved, it allows tools to run, it sent us to the moon.

English is the dominant language on this planet, mainly because of... history? Let us leave that huge subject alone.

Another language so we can see our own language structure and maybe communicate with others to avoid violence with other reigions and cultures.  By persaution, teach them to be peaceable followers of a loving God that does not want to see problems solved by violence and that yes we will defend ourselves and our families. So some need Russian, some need Arabic, and some need Chinese. I don't forsee Mexico blowing us up so Spanish is not needed, but I might be shortsighted on that, but throw it in anyway, some speaking Spanish.

Science, I firmly believe that if we train up our kids with pre-engineering that is based on underlying science, a lot of kids will expand out to be scientists. So forget Science lets get the practical engineering first.

Critical thinking and some survial skills appropriate to the decade we live in.
A little study on different methods of planing, accounting in personal finances, goal setting, and useing the app of the day for common things like loans savings and compound intrest forumluas in a spreadsheet. If the a speadsheet looks like the best current math app for that.

We need to study free market economics. How it has been the driveing force behind dramaticly raising our living. It has produced more medicine, machines, housing, then we had before the industrial revolution.

We also need to study the athoritrian countries and what happened to their economies. And the number of deaths that has inflicted in Russia, China , Venizuela.  

If you think I have attributed the above two paragraphs wrongly because you are an believer in centralise control of the economy, then grea,t teach both sides of the argument and grade on grammer.

## Number of teachers
I think we need smaller class sizes. Let us do 20 students per teacher down from 30 to 36. If we prioritize this over expensive buildings even if we have to have tents this will do more than anything else.  We have a tent city in prisons let us complete the analogy that kids make anyway and have tent schools.

## Time
You need time to teach, watching a Ted Talk, I realized that our students are spending time in a grade to advance rather than mastery advancement. Also one of the best ways to master something is to come up with your own teaching plan, Due Friday. How bout this, teaching will be mornings with breaks, afternoon Lunch and siesta aka recess then quiet study/homework time from 4 to 7. No homework after 7. Teachers will have a long 12 hour days 4 days a week, 7 to 7. School starts 8 am. Friday will be student teaching in mornings and advancement testing just after or before lunch. with a shortened day. The Teachers could do shifts on Friday because we should need fewer teachers if students are quiet testing or noisily teaching another group of students during their 15 min lesson they choose to teach. Teachers have told me they have longer days anyway with grading. Students don't have to stay up till 10 doing their homework. They should have done from 4 to 7 anyway. Things adjusted for age of course. I think that would work but not be perfect. I don't think there is a perfect system this side of the living.  I am thinking we get our teachers working 43 or 46 hours which I think they work anyway (if not more).

## Conclusion
Lots of my suggestions are negiotioable, I releise that I can not control what happens everywhere or anywhere, but I am saying that a district can provide a place to teach for three or four companys, or coOPs , or charters, the vouchers provide money for the teachers, the administration, and the groups provide different plans, and students advance on basis of projects and portfolios. The student has achived this, documented it and has shown basic prequisites to advance to the next grade, untill they are doing collage lvl stuff.  You get a highschool degree with a portfollio of usefull skills that you can brag to a employer about.  You get a citizen with a base level of understanding on how our economy was set up, how it was not run, how other governments run theirs, and reading and writing and the lanugage of Math skills.
