## Theme for website

### Current theme: none
I have uploaded just text. And no css.  This is ok for just poking aroung git locale git and just plan text.  I have some ideas. Hopefully more comes later.

### Brainstorming

I have always been a fan of the blue green of pine tree evergreens. Color Picker from the Chrome Webstore gives me this color from the solris 8 theme. #012833 ,
033, black, hsl(193,96,10), rgb(1,40,51). Close enough this will be my background color.

I was playing around in the squid notetakeing adroid app for my chromebook plus (first gen) and wrote a red neon on a bash screen piture and really liked the effect.  My p tag, ``` <p> string </p> ``` , text color maybe. With bold being an orange or maybe a deeper red.  I am going to look at noble gases and it doesn't have to be Neon, and see what color spectrum the are in a spectometer. Or what ever the device you use that splits up wavelengths so you can tell what element in burnning in a star.  Yes its a real device. No I don't remember what its called.

Xeon can be this color: #a3a8fc, #abf, lightsteelblue, hsl(236,93,81), rgb(163,168,252). Xeon torward the edge is: #3302cd, #30d, mediumblue,  hsl(254,98,40), rgb(51,2,205).

Neon is my red color here: #fe7800, #f80, darkorange, hsl(28,100,49), rgb(254,120,0) from the center and the edge complemnts this color: #fe0000, #f00, red, hsl(0,100,49), rgb(254,0,0).

Argon I like but it's a light blue, make one think of links, ``` <a href="path"> ShowLink </a> ``` , is a possablility.  Center: #75dcfd, #7ef, lightskyblue, hsl(194,97,72), rgb(117,220,253). Edge:  #00adfd, #0bf, deepskyblueh, sl(198,100,49), rgb(0,173,253).

 Hopefully those colors will get me on the way to a cohesive theme. They are all taken off of the Noble gases.

 My word editor on my 'new to me' rig that I build runs kde and so I have CuteMarkEd running. Its not my minimalist markdown that I have on my chromebook. Android app but I like both better then retext. Retext beats the pants off of nano. Nano has the cool factor of hackerdom on linux but isn't hard core vim which for what ever reason I don't have the muscle memory for the use of it. So summary of word proccess snobdom; Minimalist Markdown Android > CuteMarkED QTE > Retext GKT > Nano CLU > Vim or emacks Ick.  If you cant start a flamewar in a brainstorming sesson then when.

Based on my color psychology My links will be stable, my words will be passionate, my background is of stable fertillity. Yea Me

### Pallet Genarator sites.

I do know about sites that will give you a color pallet. This is allows uniform websites. I hear that is all the rage in design circles.

I uploaded an image from google images with the search term "neon gas color paletes" to [Colormind](http://colormind.io/image/). I got colors 401b23,465fca,4fe1dd,ea652f and f4cf8e. It uses a neral learning net and your photo. Cool.

[Colordot](https://color.hailpixel.com/) is intresting. Its mousebased. Mouse movement in the x direction is Hue. y direction is light and darkness, and the scroll wheel is saturation. Click to finalize a color.
Goofing off I got these related colors:
\#040aae, \#0533b3, \#289588, \#8d2311, and \#7b129B. It is also nice that you can see the atoms of how these complmentary colors come together, it also is to much choice for me. Not brain dead enough.

[Colorhunter.com](http://colorhunter.com/) Honestly I was trying to get to color hunt but I ended up here. Simple to use. enter one color, them or photo and it gives you options. I like it. #000108, #000077, #26455e, #0Affc4, #4334B0.

### Shoutouts Websites

Might as well do some shout outs. Hopefully I will remember to copy this to the links page. Is there an emoji for a memory ribon and is it approriate for a blog? Equireing minds want to know.
