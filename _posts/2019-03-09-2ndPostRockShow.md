# Filer Rockshow

Went to a Rock showcase today.  I was graciously offered a complementry ticket. Thank you. There were lots of sparkly crystals, and other stones that I don't know the name of, there.  It was pretty cool. I will have to show you the images.  If I am feeling really motivated this post maybe updated to show any facts I can get on various rocks.  I also parted with some dollars to bring home some geodes that I have to crack. I will call this a win.  I finished up the expirence with a hand dipped all beef corndog for 5 dollars. Fair food is delishous and pricely. Both great and sad that I don't eat it often. Now when can you really say that a corndog is a luxarious treat. I can.
