## Racism on display

Just posting a quick and dirty reaction to a think progress article.  Let it be
 clear I don't like their viewpoint. I click on their articles for two reasons.
 Google feeds serves it up because google is left leaning. Occasionally it is
 good to see someone else's viewpoint.

 ### Rundown of the article.

 Curtis FLowers is an accused and convicted murderer. He was tried 6 times for
same act.  He killed 4 people in a furniture store.
The reason he has 6 trials is because the trials are thrown out for not having
enough black people on the jury.
Trial one was thrown out.  Trial two the prosecutor tried to remove all 5 black
people so it was thrown out. Third trial he used his 15 preemptive strikes to
remove 15 black jurors. And was thrown out. Fourth trial was 11 strikes again
all black.
Brief diversion into Batson v. Kentucky.  Prosecutors have to give good reason
to remove someone if the race question is asked. Did you remove this person on
race?
The fifth trial is skipped for some reason.  Sixth trial he allowed one black
juror.  So the supreme court is looking at it.  Quick statistics given. 43
jurors he struck 41 of them with preemptive strikes.  Key caveat while he had
preemptive strikes that he didn't have to give a reason. He also questioned them
more. He asked them an average of 29 questions each and he asked white jurors
an average of 1.1 questions each for that last trial.

 ### My verdict

 Given that statistics can be used to lie, there is a case and a strong one to
 believe he is biased.  At the very least he believes that black people will be
 more likely to let other people off based on skin color or anti police bias.
 Think progress says hes racisit. Given the evidence I can't say anything about
 it.

 Given that 6 trials means that 60 people believe beyond a reasonable doubt that
 he killed people.  So he is guilty.  **Unless you're Think Progress and think white people
 and all 50ish white jurors are racist, then he is guilty**  That bugs me. That is why I wrote this post.
I am white, so does that mean my opinion doesn't ever count?

 So what is the corrective action? Let a murder go? As a lesson to prosecutors.
 Maybe, I believe in God. He is not getting away 'with it'. The victims shouldn't
 be treated like that. The murderer shouldn't be treated like he was. Reduction
 from the death sentence? Better in my view.
