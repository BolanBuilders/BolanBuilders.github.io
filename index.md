Hey, you, if you're here you probably got here by searching or following a link to one of my topical posts.  Welcome and enjoy the links above. I created this site for you to enjoy and I get to enjoy writing.  I plan to put affiliate links in so please support me by clicking those or donate to me by bitcoin address. The more I can add to this site the better, right.

The goal of this site is really rooted in my desire to create something.  If you want to improve your life create something. It builds self-confidence or competence as you do all the wrong things and then you fix them.  

Here is my shout out to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyell](https://jekyllrb.com/) that make this site possible.
